HADA MADRINA: **H**uman **A**ware **DA**ta Science for **MA**chine Learning **DRI**ve**N** **A**pplications (2021-2024)
---

This proposal arises as a natural response to cover a set of common gaps that we have identified after several years working as machine
learning (ML) experts in multidisciplinary research and innovation oriented teams in health and financial applications. To develop ML
models in these two fields is particularly difficult because the scarcity of data must be completed with a lot of prior domain knowledge, that sometimes is hard to embed in the design of the ML models. On top of that, the two fields are highly regulated, which imposes severe limitations to the black-box nature of most ML approaches. However, every time these multidisciplinar collaborations ended up in the deployment of successful model, and the domain experts experienced its potential to help them improve their decision-making processes, these non-ML native domain experts would refer the ML component as a Fairy Godmother that brought in the magic ingredient the project needed to outperform.

The project pursues the development of a Human-Aware DAta science framework for MAchine learning DRIveN Applications (HADA
MADRINA, Fairy Godmother in Spanish). HADA MADRINA is a Bayesian ML framework that helps us design those tailored ML Fairy
Godmother each project needs in a faster, robust and human-aware manner. The project starting point is a recent key research result of
the team, SSHIBA, a framework that generalizes from a Bayesian perspective many tailored ML solutions we had developed in the past to deal with specific health or finance problems.
